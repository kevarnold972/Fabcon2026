## Description

Unlock the power of your own data by combining Microsoft SQL (SQL Server 2025, Azure SQL, or SQL Database in Microsoft Fabric) with cutting-edge AI techniques. In this workshop, you’ll learn about embeddings and vector search and why they matter for modern AI applications. We’ll guide you through generating embeddings using similarity search to retrieve the most relevant data.
We’ll implement the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern by calling a Chat model, then explore its limitations.  Evolve into Agentic RAG and create an orchestrator to intelligently choose between running semantic search or writing a SQL query to answer complex requests. Learn to secure data access so that only authorized information is available to AI agents using Row-Level Security.
By the end, you’ll have built an end-to-end solution that combines SQL’s reliability with AI’s intelligence and be well prepared for SQL AI Developer certification exam.
