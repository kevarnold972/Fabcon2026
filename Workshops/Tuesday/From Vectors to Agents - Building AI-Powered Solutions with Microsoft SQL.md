## Description

Unlock the power of your own data by combining Microsoft SQL (SQL Server 2025, Azure SQL, or SQL Database in Microsoft Fabric) with cutting-edge AI techniques. In this workshop, you'll learn:

- About embeddings and vector search and why they matter for modern AI applications
- Generating embeddings using similarity search to retrieve the most relevant data
- Implementing the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern by calling a Chat model
- Exploring RAG limitations and evolving into Agentic RAG
- Creating an orchestrator to intelligently choose between running semantic search or writing a SQL query to answer complex requests
- Securing data access so that only authorized information is available to AI agents using Row-Level Security

By the end, you'll have built an end-to-end solution that combines SQL's reliability with AI's intelligence and be well prepared for SQL AI Developer certification exam.
