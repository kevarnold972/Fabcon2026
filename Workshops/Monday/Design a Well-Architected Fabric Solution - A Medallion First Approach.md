## Description

Solid data architecture is key for a scalable and maintainable pipeline, but can be difficult to implement. This session is for those familiar with Power BI or new data engineers, providing a step-by-step guide to Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

Users will gain an overview of Medallion Architecture, Warehouses and Lakehouses, Delta and Parquet, GIT integration, monitoring, and compare available Fabric tools.

This is a hands on, lab filled session. Python or SQL is a bonus but not required.
