## Description

AI makes poor business decisions when it can't see how things connect - customers to orders, assets to events, signals to root causes. Graph captures these relationships and lets you explore them with natural language, no queries needed. See how Graph surfaces hidden patterns and enriches AI reasoning. Learn to model entity relationships, query connections using natural language, and turn complex data into clear, actionable insights for your AI agents.
