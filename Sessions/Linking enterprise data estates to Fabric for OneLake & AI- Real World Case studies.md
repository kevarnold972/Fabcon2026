## Description

A key challenge in getting your data estate ready for using Fabric's unified capabilities is eliminating data silos and complexity.

In this session, Codin Pora, VP of Partner Technology at Striim, presents a set of real-world, technical use cases drawn from enterprise environments across retail, aviation, and financial services that show how teams embed mirroring, continuous streaming, CDC, transformations, data cleansing, in-line AI, and governance to deliver data pipelines into Microsoft Fabric for building operational, analytical, and AI workloads.
