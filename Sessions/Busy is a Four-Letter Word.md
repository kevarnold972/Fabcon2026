## Description

If I ask you, "How are you?", is your default answer, "I'm so busy!"? Why do we measure our worth by how much we are doing, rather than by the value of what we do?  What does this have to do with a technical conference? Join me as I share with you how I, too, was too busy for too long, but am learning how to do less, be more productive, and have bigger impact at work, the community, and at home.
