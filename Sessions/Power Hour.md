## Description

Nothing will prepare you for this fast-paced, borderline ridiculous community event!  Join us for Power Hour, a live-demo driven session that you can't afford to miss. This unique session brings together members of the Microsoft product team and members of the data community to use Microsoft Fabric, Power BI and SQL Server tools in ways never intended.  If you learn something during Power Hour, you're doing it wrong!
