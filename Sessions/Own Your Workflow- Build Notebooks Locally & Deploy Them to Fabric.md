## Description

Break free from browser IDE in Fabric Python and PySpark Notebooks! Learn to install Python and Spark, create your own local lakehouse, and develop Python and PySpark Notebooks in Visual Studio, VSCode, or whatever IDE you're used to. We'll start with a clean machine and download, install and configure everything we need. We will create a feature-rich notebook, and wrap up by deploying to Fabric.
