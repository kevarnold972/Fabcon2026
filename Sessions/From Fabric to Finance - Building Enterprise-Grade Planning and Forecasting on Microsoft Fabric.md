## Description

Microsoft Fabric has fundamentally changed how enterprises store, model, and analyze data — but many organizations still struggle to turn that data into real-time operational and financial decisions. In this session, we will explore how to design an enterprise-grade planning and forecasting architecture natively on Microsoft Fabric, using Azure SQL, Power BI, and modern data pipelines to enable real-time write-back, scenario modeling, and governed collaboration across large organizations.

Attendees will learn how to:
- Architect a Fabric-native planning environment that supports concurrent users, auditability, and data integrity
- Design write-enabled analytical models using Azure SQL, Fabric Warehouses, and Power BI
- Implement scenario modeling, forecasting, and what-if analysis directly on enterprise data
- Apply governance, security, and performance best practices for mission-critical workloads
- Avoid common pitfalls that cause Fabric-based planning solutions to fail at scale
