## Description

Without shared business definitions, AI agents give inconsistent answers and your teams waste time reconciling conflicting data. Fabric IQ creates a governed, shared semantic foundation that models your business spanning entities, relationships, and rules. See how Fabric IQ builds on existing assets like Power BI semantic models, binds with live data, and enables AI agents to answer richer questions. Learn to extend your semantic models, connect live data sources, and enable AI agents to drive intelligent, automated decisions.
