## Description

Data-engineering often results in hundreds of one-offs with duplicate code and inconsistency, making change slow, brittle, and costly. We will introduce and demo new metadata and config-driven patterns for PySpark integration in Fabric. You will learn to implement reusable patterns that simplify development, scale reliably, cut duplication, and improve governance across Fabric environments.
