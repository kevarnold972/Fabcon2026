## Description

Join us for a fast‑paced look at the latest advancements in item recovery, item creation policies, and new audit and access activity logging that provide clear insight into who accessed what, when, and how.

We’ll also highlight the broader set of investments transforming reliability and consistency across Microsoft Fabric. This includes concrete improvements that enhance customer experience and the Item Identity initiative, which ensures continuity even when item owners change or leave the organization. We’ll also explore our efforts to standardize item implementation across Fabric, helping eliminate issues caused by system‑generated items like staging lakehouses and warehouses.
