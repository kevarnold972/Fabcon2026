## Description

In this session, we will explore how Dynamics 365 Data Events enables the generation of event messages triggered by CRUD operations on data entities. These messages can be streamed to Azure Event Hubs, consumed by a Fabric Event Stream, and ultimately fed into an Eventhouse that serves as the data source for live Power BI reports. 



We will dive into several practical use cases for real-time reporting, then guide you through the setup and configuration process for this powerful solution.  



This session provides a technical deep dive into the integration of Dynamics 365, Azure, and Fabric, covering key components, architectural best practices, and real-world considerations.
