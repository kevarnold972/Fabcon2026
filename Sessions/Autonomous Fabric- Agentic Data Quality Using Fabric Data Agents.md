## Description

Data Quality issues drain engineering time and weaken business confidence in data platforms.



What if Fabric Data Agents could detect DQ issues autonomously, analyse their root cause, and guide engineers directly to a fix? 



This session demonstrates the full architecture with a live demo - capturing DQ signals, triggering agent-led investigations, and integrating agent outputs into ETL pipelines.
