## Description

Join us for a strategic look at how OneLake and Foundry enable you to build AI apps that retrieve enterprise knowledge at scale. We'll show you how to unify all your data—across clouds and on-premises—into a single data lake and then highlight patterns for building agentic workflows that plan, reason, and iterate across this governed data, moving beyond RAG to orchestrate intelligent task flows.
