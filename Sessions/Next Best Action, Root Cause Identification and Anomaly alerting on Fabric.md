## Description

Business users don't want a fancy chart - they want to know what immediate actions will help them meet their targets. They don't want to firefight once something is broken - they want to be alerted ahead of time so they can be proactive. They want deep, contextual analysis and live answers of their business so they can get a 360 view and take control.
