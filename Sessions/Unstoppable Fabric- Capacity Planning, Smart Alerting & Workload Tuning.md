## Description

Learn how to make Microsoft Fabric unstoppable by combining capacity planning, smart alerting, and workload tuning. We’ll use the Fabric Capacity Metrics app and API to read CU usage and throttling, plan and schedule ETL/Spark/refresh workloads, configure alerts (incl. Data Activator), and apply Spark/Warehouse best practices so Fabric stays fast, predictable, and cost-efficient.
