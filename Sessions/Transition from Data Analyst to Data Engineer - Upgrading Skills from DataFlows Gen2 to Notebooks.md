## Description

The session shows an analyst how to use notebooks to perform the same actions as Dataflow Gen2. Looking at 4 areas: source, transformation, cleansing, and destination, examples include append/merge query to dataframe joins, text replace functionality, split and concatenate columns, as well as pivot/unpivot, data type changes, and removing duplicates. We will finish off with engine optimizations.
