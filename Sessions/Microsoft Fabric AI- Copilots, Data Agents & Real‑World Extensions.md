## Description

Build RAG patterns in minutes. We’ll show data agents, prompts, complex queries, and connecting to Microsoft Fabric data. Explore Copilots across services—what they are, how they differ—extend data agents from Fabric to Copilot Studio, to Microsoft Teams, M365 Copilot, Microsoft Foundry, and the Python SDK.  After we build this out, let's test Row Level and Column level security in our agents!
