## About

I’m Elena, a Microsoft MVP, DataViz & UX Consultant, and international speaker on a mission to balance and clarity to the dashboard universe.

Through MoonStory, I help organizations flip their Power BI reports from cluttered and confusing to accessible, engaging, and actually delightful to use.

Whether I'm designing a report, leading a workshop, or speaking on stage, I bring a little magic, a lot of joy, and a deep belief that better data design leads to better decisions—and happier users.
