## About

I am a Product manager in Power BI for almost 10 years now. I worked on many areas of the product in Power BI service and Power BI mobile app. My main focus in these days is about how to make data more accessible for analysts and information workers to find existing organization data and reuse it. In addition I am working on some governance capabilities - data lineage and artifacts endorsement. I love speaking with customers to help me understand where are their pain points so we can design and build solutions to solve them.
