## About

I've gained valuable experience as a data engineer with a business-oriented mindset. My expertise includes Spark, Delta Lake, and Terraform, with a focus on Microsoft Azure. While these are some areas I specialize in, I have broader knowledge beyond them. I'm passionate about empowering businesses with data-driven insights and creating user-centric solutions. Additionally, I enjoy tackling architectural challenges to ensure scalable and efficient data solutions.
