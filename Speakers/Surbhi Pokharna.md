## About

I spent my career in designing and managing enterprise scale data solutions with fundamental building blocks of Reliability, Security, Scalability, Governance and Maintainability in business-critical private and public cloud data platforms in financial domain.
Architecting the operationalization aspect in a client facing role, delivering relational and advanced analytics solution for large scale Operational and Data Warehouse implementations with focus on learning and innovation remained a constant part of my data journey. 
Currently I am leading enterprise scale cloud data migrations in SQL Server/Snowflake/Azure SQL/Managed Instance/PostgreSQL and am involved with delivery of next generation Data & AI solutions using various data platforms. As a woman in tech and part of data community, I have advanced with grit to create an impact, work with the mindset of ‘how I can’, passion for continuous learning and delivering results.
