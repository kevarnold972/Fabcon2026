## About

I am a Product Manager with the SQL database in Fabric team at Microsoft. My focus is on the entire product management lifecycle, from working with development teams and user experience to collaborating with cross-functional teams to drive customer satisfaction by ensuring our products not only meet but exceed customer expectations.
Prior to joining Microsoft, I held various full time/consulting roles as a technology leader for over two decades in software lifecycle development, system integration, and enterprise architecture design. My expertise extends to Data Strategy, Analytics, and Web Content Management. Throughout my career, I have successfully led numerous projects, both small and large, from inception through to implementation. I am a proponent of the servant-leader philosophy, committed to continuous learning and empowering others to excel in their endeavors.
