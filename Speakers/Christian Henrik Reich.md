## About

Sr. Solution Architect at Microsoft. I started programming as a kid and never stopped. I have worked across everything from embedded systems to large scale data platforms. My work over the past decade has focused on Data and AI with a strong emphasis on Microsoft Fabric, SQL Server, Databricks, cloud scale architectures, modern data engineering, and Machine Learning. I volunteer teaching AI and Machine Learning, and I’m currently writing “The Data Engineer’s Guide to Microsoft Fabric” for O’Reilly.
