## About

I don't just know the Microsoft stack technically - I've lived the customer journey. I understand the organizational change management, the data governance challenges, the integration complexity, and how to translate business requirements into scalable Azure solutions. I can walk into a customer engagement and immediately identify where they are in their journey and what they need next.
