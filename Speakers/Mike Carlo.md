## About

Act like the Business think like IT

I'm very passionate about data and analytics.  I've spent a massive amount of time learning Power BI.  Through this learning process I felt that others may also be interested.  Thus, I created a website, a knowledge repository for all things Power BI, ( powerbi.tips ).  This site is uniquely set up for people to read and learn about data modeling and visualizations within Power BI.
