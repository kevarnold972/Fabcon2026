## About

I've been working in the Microsoft Data Platform for over 20 years, firstly as a DBA and now as a consultant. I joined Coeo as a Principal Data Platform Consultant in 2021 providing advice and guidance to customers modernising their SQL Server and analytics estates. I previously worked for Microsoft as a Premier Field Engineer (PFE) and as an independent database consultant, working across various sectors including financial services, retail and defence. When I'm not working with data, I'm a keen runner and enjoy spending time with my family.
