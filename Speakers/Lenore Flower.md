## About

Lenore Flower (MBA, MCT) owns Data Plumber, LLC, a training and consulting business dedicated to helping organizations build their data people alongside their data systems on Microsoft’s data stack.  An unapologetic generalist, Lenore loves helping others understand potentially intimidating concepts in data engineering and business intelligence.  

 While her technical “home base” is Power BI, she has experience working with SQL, Azure, Fabric, and D365 F&O—and a soft spot for paginated reports.  As co-organizer of the Power BI Washington, D.C. user group, Lenore has been instrumental in helping the Power BI User Group to nearly double over the past two years, including facilitating Power BI Days DC, a free two-day conference held annually in Arlington, VA. She recently launched “Beautiful Nerds”, a podcast dedicated to extending the conversation with speakers and community leaders within the Microsoft ecosystem.
