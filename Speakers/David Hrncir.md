## About

David is a software and data engineering expert.  He has spent decades in the data space, where early in his career was building big data analytics architectures…before the term “big data” was coined.  He has been on the forefront of numerous data integration projects for many verticals and truly understands the pain points of data replication and how to guide organizations down the path of data automation using the modern data stack, with a keen focus on value-based business outcomes.  David brings the fun, ‘no challenge is too big’ attitude to the world of data integration, and loves to discuss data architecture and philosophy!

With a passion for helping others, David currently works on numerous engagements with Fivetran technical partners such as speaking at partner conferences, proving capabilities with hands-on-labs, and showcasing how Fivetran integrations help customers solve their most cumbersome data woes.
