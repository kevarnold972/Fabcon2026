## About

Peer is a “strategically lazy” developer who automates anything repetitive. As a Technical Architect & Community Advocate at Tabular Editor, he champions great semantic models and solid CI/CD. Off stage, he’s kept busy by three kids, a dog, two cats, and a quest for good food, good wine, and well-designed automation… and his wife, of course.
