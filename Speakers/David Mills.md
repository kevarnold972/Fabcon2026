## About

I am an Azure Data Architect specialising in Microsoft Fabric, with 25 years of experience designing secure, scalable analytics platforms across both on-premises and Microsoft Azure environments. As a 10x Microsoft Certified Professional, I focus heavily on Fabric Security and the emerging wave of AI-powered capabilities within the platform.

I share insights regularly on LinkedIn, deliver Microsoft Fabric Analyst in a Day (FAIAD) workshops, and speak at community events including the Manchester Power BI & Fabric User Group. My work spans end-to-end platform design from data warehousing and modelling to real-time analytics and Power BI.

My current focus area is Fabric Data Agents, and how organisations can safely leverage autonomous, AI-driven workflows to enhance productivity, governance, and data quality.

Attendees can expect clear, practical guidance drawn from real implementations and hands-on experimentation with the newest Fabric features.
