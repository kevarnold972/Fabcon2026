## About

I am an Azure Data Engineer and Data & AI Consultant with expertise in Microsoft Fabric, Azure Data Platform, and Python. I design and implement scalable, secure data architectures, specializing in ETL pipelines and data migration for complex business solutions. My experience spans global banking M&A projects, IoT network analytics, and healthcare data processing. I’ve built Power BI dashboards for enterprise reporting, automated network topology generation using graph theory, and developed NLP pipelines for sensitive medical data. I have hands-on experience training and deploying machine learning models, including logistic regression and neural networks, and I’m passionate about leveraging AI Foundry and real-time intelligence to unlock actionable insights. With a strong foundation in data engineering and a focus on innovation, I aim to bridge technology and business value through modern data platforms and AI-driven solutions.
