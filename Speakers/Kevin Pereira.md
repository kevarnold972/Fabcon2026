## About

I’m a data professional with nearly 20 years of experience turning data into strategic assets. My expertise spans the Microsoft data stack (SQL, SSIS, SSRS, SSAS, Azure Data Platform, and Power BI) with the last two years focused on Microsoft Fabric. 

I have 8 years of experience building CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps and 3 years leading Data Engineering teams to deliver scalable solutions. Passionate about community, I co-lead the DFW Power BI User Group and speak at events including SQL Saturday, user groups, and the Microsoft Fabric Community Conference in the US and Europe.
